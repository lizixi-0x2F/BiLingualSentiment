# MoE Integration Results

## Implementation Overview

Successfully integrated a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module into the model with the following features:

1. **MoE Architecture**:
   - Implemented with configurable number of experts (default: 4)
   - Top-k routing mechanism (default: k=2)
   - Expert networks with configurable hidden dimensions
   - Added noise factor for training exploration

2. **Model Integration**:
   - Controlled by a config flag `use_moe: true`
   - Placed after the transformer encoder but before the prediction heads
   - Preserves output shape and dimensions
   - No effect on loss calculation structure

3. **Validation Results**:
   - MoE module standalone tests passed
   - Model integration tests passed with appropriate shape checks
   - Successfully completed a training step with gradient flow
   - Config integration test confirmed MoE can be enabled via YAML config

## Testing

Validation tests showed:
- Correct routing behavior with routing weights summing to 1.0
- Expert usage statistics show the distribution of input across experts
- Loss values with MoE: 1.352480
- Loss values without MoE: 0.918740
- Different loss values confirm that MoE is affecting the model behavior but not breaking the training process

## Next Steps

1. Run a full training experiment with MoE enabled
2. Fine-tune the number of experts and routing parameters
3. Consider implementing expert specialization mechanisms
4. Analyze expert utilization during training
